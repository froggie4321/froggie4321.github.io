             Mobi has been redesigned to become more focused on inclusivity and community building. To match the new vision on summer 2022 it was decided to rip out all the old administration to build the non-profit organization from the ground up. This meant making a new constitution, Admininstration documentation, Financial strategy, Logo, Resource Documentation, Design Templates, Marketing Strategy, Roadmap, onboarding/offboarding strategy, social media, and websites updates. The effort is not wasted, As the foundation laid this summer will allow Mobi future to be clear. As the Vice-Presiden of Mobi i am glad to be part of the group of hard working officers that have sheperd the change of direction of mobi.

       MavStudy was created to bring students at the University of Texas At Arlington an easy to use phone app focused on the Central library. We worked together with Duncan Mathew, an adminstrator at the Central library, on developement of the Application. The app focused on two key areas. First allowing students to book central library rooms remotely. Secondly allowing users to see items available to rent from the central library. When the user is booking a room they will have the option to select the room, date, and time from the app. When the user is looking to borrow an item they will get a picture of aforementioned item, a short descriptions showing how long they can borrow an item, and how many are currently in stock. The user will also have access to their past room booking details. The app also had all the usual features such as login verification, user profile customization, and a history view.

        Octagon Temple is a community driven software project spearhead by Mobi and CSEC. The goal of the project is to develope a point system that can be used by clubs in the university to track members engagement. The project revolved around the idea of using an NFC token to store points in a decentralized manner. The NFC token could then be scanned in an PN532 NFC reader that was connected to a raspeberri pi for authentication, reading, and writting of the Token. The user will also be able to check their points on an app that is made using the React Native Framework. The team working on Octagon Temple is assembled by a broad range of students from the University of Texas at Arlignton.
